{\bfseries{Description\+:}} Computes a series of normal 2d cross sections from a 3d curve {\bfseries{curve.\+list}} and image {\bfseries{in.\+pgm}}.

Method\+:

1/ computes a cubic spline from the curve, with tolerance given by parameter {\bfseries{tolerance}} .

2/ samples the spline to obtain {\bfseries{n\+\_\+samples}} points, and computes the tangents at these points

3/ at each sample point, extract a 2D section from {\bfseries{in.\+pgm}} in the plane normal to the tangent. Delete the pixels at distance larger than {\bfseries{clip\+\_\+rad}} from the basis origin.
