 {\bfseries{Description\+:}}

Convert a 4-\/connected (6-\/connected, in 3D) edge-\/weighted graph ({\bfseries{graph.\+ga}}) into its Khalimsky grid representation (depending on the parameter {\bfseries{type}}), stored as a pgm image ({\bfseries{out.\+pgm}}). The vertices of the graph are associated to the square of the Khalimsky grid, and the edges of the graphs are associated to the line segments.

If type = 0, then the closure of the set of weighted-\/edges is used (usefull for representing contours). ~\newline


If type = 1, then the dual of the closure of the set of weighted edges is used (usefull for representing regions).

 {\bfseries{Types supported\+:}} ga 2d, ga 3d
