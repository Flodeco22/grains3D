{\bfseries{Description\+:}}

Computes a covering of a digital curve by digital straight line segments. The input file contains a curve which is specified by the ordered list of its points. The output file is an ordered list of points, which are the extremities of the segments.

Parameter {\bfseries{tolerance}} gives the thickness of the digital straight line segments. Default value is 1.

\begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
Curves must be 8-\/curves in 2D of 26-\/curves in 3D. Greedy algorithm.
