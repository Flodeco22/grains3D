{\bfseries{Usage\+:}} watershed\+Meyer2lab marker image \{roi$\vert$null\} connex [mode] out

{\bfseries{Description\+:}} Performs the watershed transformation on the image {\bfseries{image}}, taking the set of markers in {\bfseries{marker}}, in the form of a label image where all the pixels sharing the same label (even if not connected) belong to the same marker. If this parameter is present, {\bfseries{roi}} indicates the region of interest on which the operation is performed. The parameter {\bfseries{connex}} gives the adjacency relation (4,8 in 2D; 6,18,26 in 3D) for the makers.

The result is a label image. If the original markers are labelled by numbers 1,...,n then the regions (catchment basins) of the result will be labelled with the same numbers.

If the optional parameter {\bfseries{mode}} is 0 (default value), then the separation (watershed) will be labelled with n+1. Otherwise, a separating point that is neighbour of exactly two regions i and j will be labelled by j$\ast$(n+1)+i, with i$<$j, and a separating point that is neighbour of more than two regions be labelled by n+1. Thus, from any label L $>$ n+1, one can recover the labels of the two regions i,j in contact by doing\+: i = L\%(n+1); j = L/(n+1).
