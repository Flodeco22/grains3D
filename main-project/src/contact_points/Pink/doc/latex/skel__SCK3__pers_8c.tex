{\bfseries{Description\+:}} Topological persistence of 1D isthmuses, based on parallel 3D asymetric thinning.

When a point x is detected as a 1D isthmus, a counter p(x) is associated to this point and initialized with value 1. This counter is incremented a each iteration as long as x is still an isthmus. When this point x is eventually deleted, the value of the counter is freezed.
