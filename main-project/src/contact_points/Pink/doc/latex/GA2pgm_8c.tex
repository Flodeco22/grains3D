Convert a 4-\/connected edge-\/weighted graph ({\bfseries{graph.\+ga}}) into a pgm image ({\bfseries{out.\+pgm}}) where each pixel represents a vertex of the input graph and the gray level of a pixel is obtained from the values of its incident edges by means of an operation depending of the parameter {\bfseries{param}}.

If param = 1, then max is used, and if param = 2, min is used.
