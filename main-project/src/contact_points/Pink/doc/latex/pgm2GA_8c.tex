Computes an edge-\/weighted graph from an image. 

{\bfseries{Usage\+:}} pgm2\+GA im.\+pgm param [alpha] out.\+ga ~\newline
 {\bfseries{Description\+:}}

Computes a GA (an edge-\/weighted graph) from an image. The values of an edge linking two pixels \{x,y\} is computed according to the parameter {\bfseries{param}}.

If param = 0, the absolute difference of intensity between x and y is used.

If param = 1, the maximum between the intensities of x and y is used.

If param = 2, the minimum between the intensities of x and y is used.

If param = 3, a Deriche-\/like gradient is used, the optional parameter alpha specifies the spatial extention of the filter (by default alpha is set to 1]),

If im.\+pgm is a 2D (resp. 3D) image, then {\bfseries{out.\+ga}} is a 2D (resp 3D GA), that is a 2D 4-\/connected edge-\/weighted graph (resp. a 2D 6-\/connected edge-\/weighted graph).

{\bfseries{Types supported\+:}} GA byte 2D, GA byte 3D, GA float 2D
