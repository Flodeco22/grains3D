{\bfseries{Usage\+:}} drawspline in.\+pgm spline.\+txt [len] out.\+pgm

{\bfseries{Description\+:}} Draws a spline which is specified by its control points. The control points are read in the text file {\bfseries{spline.\+txt}} . The parameter {\bfseries{in.\+pgm}} gives an image into which the spline is to be drawn. The file format for {\bfseries{spline.\+txt}} is the following for 2D\+:

c n+1 (where n+1 denotes the number of control points)~\newline
 x1 y1~\newline
 ...~\newline
 xn+1 yn+1~\newline
 C0\+X1 C0\+Y1 C1\+X1 C1\+Y1 C2\+X1 C2\+Y1 C3\+X1 C3\+Y1~\newline
 ...~\newline
 C0\+Xn C0\+Yn C1\+Xn C1\+Yn C2\+Xn C2\+Yn C3\+Xn C3\+Yn~\newline


and in the 3D case\+:

C n+1 (where n+1 denotes the number of control points)~\newline
 x1 y1 z1~\newline
 ...~\newline
 xn+1 yn+1 zn+1~\newline
 C0\+X1 C0\+Y1 C0\+Z1 C1\+X1 C1\+Y1 C1\+Z1 C2\+X1 C2\+Y1 C2\+Z1 C3\+X1 C3\+Y1 C3\+Z1~\newline
 ...~\newline
 C0\+Xn C0\+Yn C0\+Zn C1\+Xn C1\+Yn C1\+Zn C2\+Xn C2\+Yn C2\+Zn C3\+Xn C3\+Yn C3\+Zn~\newline


If parameter {\bfseries{len}} is given and non-\/zero, the spline is extended on both sides by straight line segments of length {\bfseries{len}}.
