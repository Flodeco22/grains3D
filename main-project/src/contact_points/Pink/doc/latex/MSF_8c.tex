\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Compute a minimum spanning forest of a GA from a set of markers. 

{\bfseries{Usage\+:}} MSF GAin.\+ga marqueurs.\+pgm type\+Resul Result.?? ~\newline


{\bfseries{Description\+:}}

Compute a minimum spanning forest of {\bfseries{GAin.\+ga}} (a 4-\/connected 2D or 6-\/connected 3D edge-\/weighted graph) relative to the connected components of the non-\/zero pixels of {\bfseries{marqueurs.\+pgm}}. If Type\+Result = 0, then Result.?? is a GA whose non-\/zero edges form the induced MSF cut, otherwise Result.?? is a label image that represents the vertex partition induced by the MSF (the connected components of the MSF are marked with distinct labels).

See [COUSTYet\+Al-\/\+PAMI2009] and [COUSTYet\+Al-\/\+PAMI2010] for more details.

{\bfseries{Types supported\+:}} GA byte 2D, GA byte 3D
