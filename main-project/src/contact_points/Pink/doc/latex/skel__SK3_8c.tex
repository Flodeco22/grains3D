{\bfseries{Usage\+:}} skel\+\_\+\+SK3 in.\+pgm nsteps [inhibit] out.\+pgm

{\bfseries{Description\+:}} Parallel 3D binary thinning or surface skeleton based on 2D isthmuses. The parameter {\bfseries{nsteps}} gives, if positive, the number of parallel thinning steps to be processed. If the value given for {\bfseries{nsteps}} equals -\/1, the thinning is continued until stability.

If the parameter {\bfseries{inhibit}} is given and is a binary image name, then the points of this image will be left unchanged.

{\bfseries{Warning\+:}} The object must not have any point on the frame of the image.

{\bfseries{Types supported\+:}} byte 3d

{\bfseries{Category\+:}} topobin
