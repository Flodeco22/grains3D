{\bfseries{Description\+:}} Parallel 3D binary thinning or surface, asymetric skeleton based on thin 2D isthmuses. The parameter {\bfseries{nsteps}} gives, if positive, the number of parallel thinning steps to be processed. If the value given for {\bfseries{nsteps}} equals -\/1, the thinning is continued until stability.

When a point x is detected as a 2D isthmus, a counter p(x) is associated to this point and initialized with value 1. This counter is incremented a each iteration as long as x is still an isthmus. At each iteration, the isthmuses x such that p(x) $>$= {\bfseries{isthmus\+\_\+persistence}} are stored as a constraint set (see also {\bfseries{inhibit}} parameter).

If the parameter {\bfseries{inhibit}} is given and is a binary image name, then the points of this image will be left unchanged.

\begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
The object must not have any point on the frame of the image.
