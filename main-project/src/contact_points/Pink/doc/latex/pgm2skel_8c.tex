decomposition of a curvilinear skeleton into isolated points, end points, curves and junctions  




\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
decomposition of a curvilinear skeleton into isolated points, end points, curves and junctions 

{\bfseries{Usage\+:}} pgm2skel in.\+pgm connex [len] out.\+skel

{\bfseries{Description\+:}} The skeleton found in {\bfseries{in.\+pgm}} is decomposed into isolated points, end points, curves and junctions ; and its description is stored in {\bfseries{out.\+skel}} . The parameter {\bfseries{connex}} sets the adjacency relation used for the object (4, 8 (2d) or 6, 18, 26 (3d)).

The optional parameter \textbackslash{}len indicates the minimum length (in pixels/voxels) of a curve.

If a set of curve points with less than \textbackslash{}len points, then\+:

a) if it contains at least one end point it will be eliminated (together with its end point(s)),

b) otherwise it will be considered as part of a junction. ~\newline


If this parameter is given, then isolated points will be eliminated.

The format of the file \textbackslash{}out.skel is described in PINKDIR/doc/formats.\+txt (section\+: Curvilinear skeletons).

\begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
Points at the border of the image will be ignored.

IMPORTANT LIMITATION\+: different junctions in the original image must not be in direct contact with each other (i.\+e., connected) otherwise they will be considered as a single junction. To prevent this to occur, one can increase image resolution.
