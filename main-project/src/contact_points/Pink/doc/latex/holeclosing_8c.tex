3d hole closing  




\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
3d hole closing 

{\bfseries{Usage\+:}} holeclosing in connex holesize [guide] out

{\bfseries{Description\+:}} Hole closing in 3d binary images. The parameter {\bfseries{connex}} gives the connectivity used for the object; possible choices are 6 and 26. Holes which have a "{}size"{} greater (strictly) than {\bfseries{holesize}} are let open (where -\/1 is used as a symbol for infinity).

Let X be the set of points of the binary image {\bfseries{in}}, let Y be a full enclosing box. The algorithm is the following\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}Repeat until stability:
    Select a point p of Y \ X such that Tb(p,Y) = 1
        or such that Tb(p,Y) = 2 and d(p,X) > holesize
        which is at the greatest distance from X
    Y := Y \ {p}
Result: Y
\end{DoxyVerb}


If the optional parameter {\bfseries{guide}} is given, then replace \textquotesingle{}greatest distance from X\textquotesingle{} by \textquotesingle{}greatest distance from Y\textquotesingle{} in the algorithm, Y being the set of non-\/null points of image {\bfseries{guide}}.

\begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
There must be no object point on the border of the image (a test is done).
\end{DoxyWarning}
