 {\bfseries{Description\+:}}

Computes a GA (an edge-\/weighted graph) from a color image. The values of an edge linking two pixels \{x,y\} is computed according to the parameter {\bfseries{param}}.

If param = 0, the maximum, over the RGB chanels, of absolute differences of intensities between x and y is used.

If param = 1, the Euclidean distance between the values of x and y is used.

If param = 2, fuzzy affinity between x and y is used.

If im.\+ppm is a 2D (resp. 3D) image, then {\bfseries{out.\+ga}} is a 2D (resp 3D GA), that is a 2D 4-\/connected edge-\/weighted graph (resp. a 2D 6-\/connected edge-\/weighted graph).
