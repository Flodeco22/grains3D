{\bfseries{Description\+:}} Compute the center of gravity of each labeled region. Labels should be consecutive integers. Only strictly positive labels are considered. The result is an image that contains labelled points. More precisely, each barycentre is represented by the nearest grid point that is given the same label as the region.
