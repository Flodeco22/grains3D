\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This structure frees the images, that have been allocated by readimage. 

description As readimage is a C function, it uses malloc to allocate it\textquotesingle{}s images. The images can not be pre-\/allocated as their type and size is not known at the time readimage is called. This object is used to \textquotesingle{}free\textquotesingle{} the memory when ujoi is created from an xvimage. Note that the data is not copyed, so the xvimage structure should not be automatically freed. 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
\textbf{ ujimage.\+hpp}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
