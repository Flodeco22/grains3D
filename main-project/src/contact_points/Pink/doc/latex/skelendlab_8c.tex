homotopic skeleton of a 2d or 3d label image with dynamic detection of end points  




\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
homotopic skeleton of a 2d or 3d label image with dynamic detection of end points 

{\bfseries{Usage\+:}} skelendlab in.\+pgm connex [n] out.\+pgm

{\bfseries{Description\+:}} Homotopic skeletonization by iterative removal of simple, non-\/end points. Each label is treated separately as a binary image. Breadth-\/first strategy. During the first {\bfseries{n}} iterations (default 0), the end points are removed as well. If {\bfseries{n}} = -\/1, the end points are always removed.

{\bfseries{Types supported\+:}} byte 2d, byte 3d

{\bfseries{Category\+:}} topobin

\begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
This operator is very sensitive to small contour irregularities. See skelcurv for a more robust operator. Useful for reducing quasi-\/curvilinear objects.
