watershed transformation without line of separation from labelled marker  




\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
watershed transformation without line of separation from labelled marker 

{\bfseries{Usage\+:}} watershedwithoutlinelab in mark \{roi$\vert$null\} connex out

{\bfseries{Description\+:}} Performs the watershed transformation on the image {\bfseries{in}}, taking the labelled marker in {\bfseries{mark}}. If this parameter is present, {\bfseries{roi}} indicates the region of interest on which the operation is performed. The parameter {\bfseries{connex}} gives the adjacency relation (4,8 in 2D; 6,18,26 in 3D) for the makers.

The image mark is a label image (int32\+\_\+t)

The image out is a label image (int32\+\_\+t)

This version does not create any line to separate the catchment basins.

{\bfseries{Types supported\+:}} byte 2d, byte 3d
