This software is an image processing library whose purpose is to be used primarily for research and teaching.

This software is governed by the Ce\+CILL license under French law and abiding by the rules of distribution of free software. You can use, modify and/or redistribute the software under the terms of the Ce\+CILL license as circulated by CEA, CNRS and INRIA at the following URL "{}http\+://www.\+cecill.\+info"{}.

As a counterpart to the access to the source code and rights to copy, modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only with a limited warranty and the software\textquotesingle{}s author, the holder of the economic rights, and the successive licensors have only limited liability.

In this respect, the user\textquotesingle{}s attention is drawn to the risks associated with loading, using, modifying and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user in light of its specific status of free software, that may mean that it is complicated to manipulate, and that also therefore means that it is reserved for developers and experienced professionals having in-\/depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the software\textquotesingle{}s suitability as regards their requirements in conditions enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and, more generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions as regards security.

The fact that you are presently reading this means that you have had knowledge of the Ce\+CILL license. You don\textquotesingle{}t have to accept the License, but note that nothing other than this License grants you permission to use, propagate or modify any covered work.\doxysection{Download}\label{index_download}
The download is available either in source form or in binary packages for the most popular Linux distributions. Microsoft Windows installer is also available, but it\textquotesingle{}s compiled less frequently. Note that neither the source codes nor the binary packages are signed and so You have to be cautious using them in a production environment. Also there are numerous Python packages used by certain Pink operators. For example PIL, Tkinter, vtk, etc. You CAN import Pink even ff these packages are not present on the system. You will receive several messages.\doxysection{Nomenclature}\label{download_nomenclature}
As of may 2011 there is only one version of Pink available (0.\+9). It is using the rolling development model. The packages carry the corresponding svn versions. For example pink-\/0.\+9.\+r1001 means that the package has been generated from the 1001th svn revision.\doxysection{Source Code}\label{download_source_code}
The source code is extracted from the main svn development repository held currently on the servers of ESIEE Engineering. This svn repository is not public. The package is generated weakly together with the webpage, which is generated from the source code. Note that the access rights to the repository are not strictly cared for, so the packages are not signed. If you need a signed version of the package, please contact one of the main developers.

The sources are accessible on {\texttt{ Source\+Forge Pinkimage}}~\newline
.\doxysection{Binary Packages}\label{download_binary_packages}
The binary packages are generated by the Open\+Su\+SE Build Service. They are generated weakly directly from the source packages. As of may 2011 these packages neither include development functions nor the bash front-\/end. Both can be compiled from the source packages, but then the binary packages would have much more dependencies. As the binary packages are built on line, there are no means to actually verify their content. Only use these packages if You trust the Open\+Su\+SE build service. You can download binary packages for the following distributions (both 32bit and 64bit versions)\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\texttt{ open\+SUSE Tumbleweed (this is a rolling distribution)}} 
\item {\texttt{ Open\+Su\+SE 11.\+3 }} 
\item {\texttt{ Open\+Su\+SE 11.\+4 }} 
\item {\texttt{ Open\+Su\+SE Factory }} 
\item {\texttt{ Debian 6.\+0 / Ubuntu 11.\+4 / Ubuntu 11.\+10 }} 
\item {\texttt{ Fedora\+\_\+14 }} 
\item {\texttt{ Fedora\+\_\+15 }} 
\item {\texttt{ Mandriva 2010 }} 
\item {\texttt{ Mandriva 2010.\+1 }} 
\item {\texttt{ Red\+Hat Enterprise Linux 6}} 
\item {\texttt{ Su\+SE Linux Enterprise 11 }} 
\item {\texttt{ Su\+SE Linux Enterprise 11 SP1}} 
\end{DoxyItemize}

Note\+: open\+Su\+SE 11.\+2, Fedora 12 and Fedora 13 has reached its end of life.\doxysection{Microsoft Windows installer}\label{download_msvc}
The Microsoft Windows version is compiled using Microsoft Visual Studio 10. To be able to install it, first you need to install the {\texttt{ Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86) }}. The installer can be found at {\texttt{ Source\+Forge }}.
