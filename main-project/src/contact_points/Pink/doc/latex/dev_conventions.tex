This page describes the function format for the Pink Image Processing Library.\doxysection{Introduction}\label{python_export_introduction}
To facilitate development, particularly to facilitate others understanding/improoving your code we use general guidelines for the functions in Pink. These guidelines ease particularcly the front-\/end development, as less types there are less templates are necessary. If your functions could be transformed in one of the declared formats, it should be. If, however your function cannot respect any of the known formats (for example, the size of the result image is different than the size of the input image), feel free to omit them.\doxysection{Programming Languages}\label{dev_conventions_languages}
Pink functions can be written in C, C++ and Python. Scripts written in Tcl or Bash are discouraged as they make the library more difficult to use and to compile/port. Also except for the Python documentation generation (which is done by a Python script) you should not invoke any script of any language during the compilation. This concerns yacc/bison/lex/flex, sed, swig or any preprocessing languages. These languages would make the compilation more complex, and would obligate the potencial developper to learn and master more and more programming/preprocessing languages.\doxysection{Image types}\label{dev_conventions_image_type}
Pink deals mostly with black and white images, but color images are also supported, at least as a format. The main image structure is xvimage. In C++ xvimage is represented by the ujoi$<$pixel\+\_\+type$>$ object. ujoi$<$$>$ can be converted (casted) in xvimage$\ast$ in constant time and memory, so C++ functions can call C without penalties. There are some shortcuts to image types. At the time of writing the following image types exist in Pink\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{struct\ }xvimage;\ \textcolor{comment}{//\ represents\ all\ the\ supported\ image\ types\ in\ C\ format}}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{class\ }ujoi<unsigned\ byte>\ \ <=>\ char\_image\ \ \ \ \ \textcolor{comment}{//\ represents\ a\ byte\ image}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{class\ }ujoi<unsigned\ short>\ <=>\ short\_image\ \ \ \ \textcolor{comment}{//\ represents\ a\ short\ image}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{class\ }ujoi<int>\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ <=>\ int\_image\ \ \ \ \ \ \textcolor{comment}{//\ represents\ a\ int\ image}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{class\ }ujoi<float>\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ <=>\ float\_image\ \ \ \ \textcolor{comment}{//\ represents\ a\ float\ image}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{class\ }ujoi<double>\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ <=>\ double\_image\ \ \ \textcolor{comment}{//\ represents\ a\ double\ image}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{class\ }ujoi<fcomplex>\ \ \ \ \ \ \ <=>\ fcomplex\_image\ \textcolor{comment}{//\ represents\ a\ complex\ image}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{class\ }ujoi<dcomplex>\ \ \ \ \ \ \ <=>\ dcomplex\_image\ \textcolor{comment}{//\ represents\ a\ complex\ image}}

\end{DoxyCode}
\doxysection{General conventions}\label{dev_conventions_general_conventions}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Operators have to test function types and constraints themselves.~\newline


The operators don\textquotesingle{}t have to support all Pink image formats, but they have to test themselves. That is to say, if the function \textquotesingle{}skeleton\textquotesingle{} can only operate on 2D images, it has to reject 3D images. It cannot suppose, that the images have the good type or properties. This is a necessery choice to make the library usable by non-\/developers.


\item Never write anything to the disk unless explicitly asked for.~\newline
 All the calculation should be carried out in the memory. This also concerns interactive functions and scripts like threasholding or rendering. The disk operations slow down the processing considerably, whereas you only rarely meet a case, where your image does not fit into the memory. In this case you still have the swap as memory management automation. If you know that you will certainly not fit into the swap, you should have a non-\/default option for memory mapping. 
\end{DoxyItemize}\doxysection{C functions}\label{python_export_c_functions}
To avoid incompatibilities between C and C++ the C functions should not allocate memory for the result image. Three types of C pink operators are declared. These functions are automatically wrapped to Python. For non conventional functions an additional C++ wrapper function has to be written. 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Standard functions}}\+:

Functions with the same result-\/type as image type\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}int pink_c_function( struct xvimage* image, T1 t1, T2 t2, ... Tn tn);
\end{DoxyVerb}


Here the types Tk can be \textquotesingle{}struct xvimage$\ast$\textquotesingle{} or any other type. At the end of the function, the result should be copied into the \textquotesingle{}image\textquotesingle{} variable. The function should return 1 if it succeeded and 0 it had failed. You can also use exit or (f)printf if you detect some error.


\item {\bfseries{ Result functions }}\+:

If your image type is different than that of the input image, but otherwise the same for all image types you should use the type\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}int pink_c_result(struct xvimage* image, T1 t1, T2 t2, ..., Tn tn, struct xvimage * result);
\end{DoxyVerb}


In this case the image type of the result should always be the same. You should use this signature for example if you have a binary image, and you know, that the result is a distance map (double). You should not allocate result image inside your function. Instead assume, that an image with the same size as \textquotesingle{}image\textquotesingle{} is allocated with the appropriate image type. In the end you copy the result in \textquotesingle{}result\textquotesingle{}. The function should return 1 if it succeeded and 0 it had failed. You can also use exit or (f)printf if you detect some error.


\item {\bfseries{Value Functions}}

These functions calculate a number (integer or float) about the image. Typically average, max or sum are such operators. The function used is\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}value_type pink_c_value(T0 t0, T1 t1, ..., Tn tn);
\end{DoxyVerb}


Your function can accept any type Tk \textquotesingle{}struct xvimage$\ast$\textquotesingle{} or other and can have any simple result type. You can use exit or (f)printf if you detect some error. 
\end{DoxyItemize}\doxysection{C++ functions}\label{dev_conventions_cpp_functions}
Pink functions written in C++ should use the functional paradigm. That is they should have only constant parameters, and return a value or an image. If they need to return more then one value as a result, they should definitely use \textquotesingle{}struct\textquotesingle{} instead of modifying the paremeters\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}result_type pink_cpp_function( const T0 t0, const T1 t1, ..., const Tn tn )
\end{DoxyVerb}


There are several things to note about this declaration\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If there is at least one image parameter, than this parameter should be t0.


\item Because ujoi$<$$>$ is a smart pointer class, even if you call the copy constructor, it will be in constant time.


\item Also if the result\+\_\+type is an image, then returning it makes a copy, but because of the smart pointers, this copy is in constant time. 
\end{DoxyItemize}

The function should test the images on the input. If it can, for example, only work with 2D images, it should test the dimensions of the input at the beginning. In the case that the image detects an error it should call the \textquotesingle{}error\textquotesingle{} macro, with the most complete description of the errors detected. The error macro declaration can be found in the beginning of the c++ functions.\doxysection{Python scripts}\label{dev_conventions_python_scripts}
Python scripts are called directly from python. These scripts should respect the format of the wrapped function to simplify the utilization of the library. Generally a python function looks like\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}def pink_python_function(t0, t1, t2, ..., tn)
\end{DoxyVerb}


If there is an image parameter, t0 should be an image parameter. In the end the functions should return the result with the \textquotesingle{}return\textquotesingle{} statement. Possible errors should be raised.
