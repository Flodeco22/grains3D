curvilinear binary skeleton guided by a priority image based on end points  




\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
curvilinear binary skeleton guided by a priority image based on end points 

{\bfseries{Usage\+:}} skelcurvend in.\+pgm prio connex [inhibit] out.\+pgm

{\bfseries{Description\+:}} Curvilinear binary skeleton guided by a priority image. The lowest values of the priority image correspond to the highest priority. End points are dynamically detected and added as control points.

The parameter {\bfseries{prio}} is either an image (byte or int32\+\_\+t or float or double), or a numerical code indicating that a distance map will be used as a priority image; the possible choices are\+: \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 0\+: approximate euclidean distance \item 1\+: approximate quadratic euclidean distance \item 2\+: chamfer distance \item 3\+: exact quadratic euclidean distance \item 4\+: 4-\/distance in 2d \item 8\+: 8-\/distance in 2d \item 6\+: 6-\/distance in 3d \item 18\+: 18-\/distance in 3d \item 26\+: 26-\/distance in 3d\end{DoxyItemize}
The parameter {\bfseries{connex}} indicates the connectivity of the binary object. Possible choices are 4, 8 in 2d and 6, 26 in 3d.

If the parameter {\bfseries{inhibit}} is given and is a binary image name, then the points of this image will be left unchanged.

Let X be the set corresponding to the input image {\bfseries{in.\+pgm}}. Let P be the function corresponding to the priority image. Let I be the set corresponding to the inhibit image, if given, or the empty set otherwise. The pseudo-\/code for priority-\/based algorithms is the following\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}C = null image
Repeat until stability
  choose a point x in X \ I, simple for X, such that C[x] == 0 
    and such that P[x] is minimal
  X = X \ {x}
  for all y in gamma(x)
    if y is an end point then C[y] = 1
Result: X
\end{DoxyVerb}
