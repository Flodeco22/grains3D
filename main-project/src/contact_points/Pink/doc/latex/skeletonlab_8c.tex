{\bfseries{Description\+:}} Ultimate binary skeleton on label image guided by a priority image. For simple point testing, each label is treated as if all other labels are turned to 0 (background). For computing distance maps, all labels are turned to 1 (foregroung). The lowest values of the priority image correspond to the highest priority.

The parameter {\bfseries{prio}} is either an image (byte, int32\+\_\+t, float or double), or a numerical code indicating that a distance map will be used as a priority image; the possible choices are\+: \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 0\+: approximate euclidean distance \item 1\+: approximate quadratic euclidean distance \item 2\+: chamfer distance \item 3\+: exact quadratic euclidean distance \item 4\+: 4-\/distance in 2d \item 8\+: 8-\/distance in 2d \item 6\+: 6-\/distance in 3d \item 18\+: 18-\/distance in 3d \item 26\+: 26-\/distance in 3d\end{DoxyItemize}
The parameter {\bfseries{connex}} indicates the connectivity of the binary object. Possible choices are 4, 8 in 2d and 6, 26 in 3d.

If the parameter {\bfseries{inhibit}} is given and is an integer different from -\/1, then the points which correspond to this priority value will be left unchanged. If the parameter {\bfseries{inhibit}} is given and is a binary image name, then the points of this image will be left unchanged.

Let X be the set corresponding to the input image {\bfseries{in.\+pgm}}. Let P be the function corresponding to the priority image. Let I be the set corresponding to the inhibit image, if given, or the empty set otherwise. The algorithm is the following\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}Repeat until stability
    Select a point x in X \ I such that P[x] is minimal
    If x is simple for X then
        X = X \ {x}
Result: X
\end{DoxyVerb}
