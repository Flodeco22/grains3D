{\bfseries{Description\+:}} Generation of a graph from a curvilinear skeleton.

The parameter {\bfseries{mode}} has the following meaning (default is 0)\+:

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 0\+: vertices of the graphs are elements (ends, curves, junctions, isolated points) of the skeleton\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 1\+: vertices of the graph are only ends, isolated points and junctions of the skeleton\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 2\+: each curve of the skeleton (not including its ends) is represented by N edges and N-\/1 vertices of the graph, where N is set to {\bfseries{param}} \end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 3\+: each curve of the skeleton (not including its end) is represented by N edges and N-\/1 vertices of the graph, where N is set to max(1, trunc(len / {\bfseries{param}})), where len is the number of points of the curve.\end{DoxyItemize}
{\bfseries{Types supported\+:}} 2Dskel, 3Dskel
