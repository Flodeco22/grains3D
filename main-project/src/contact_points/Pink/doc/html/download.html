<h1><a class="anchor" id="download"></a>
Download</h1>
<p>The download is available either in source form or in binary packages for the most popular Linux distributions. Microsoft Windows installer is also available, but it's compiled less frequently. Note that neither the source codes nor the binary packages are signed and so You have to be cautious using them in a production environment. Also there are numerous Python packages used by certain Pink operators. For example PIL, Tkinter, vtk, etc. You CAN import Pink even ff these packages are not present on the system. You will receive several messages.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="nomenclature"></a>
Nomenclature</h1>
<p>As of may 2011 there is only one version of Pink available (0.9). It is using the rolling development model. The packages carry the corresponding svn versions. For example pink-0.9.r1001 means that the package has been generated from the 1001th svn revision.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="source_code"></a>
Source Code</h1>
<p>The source code is extracted from the main svn development repository held currently on the servers of ESIEE Engineering. This svn repository is not public. The package is generated weakly together with the webpage, which is generated from the source code. Note that the access rights to the repository are not strictly cared for, so the packages are not signed. If you need a signed version of the package, please contact one of the main developers.</p>
<p>The sources are accessible on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pinkimage/files/">SourceForge Pinkimage</a><br  />
.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="binary_packages"></a>
Binary Packages</h1>
<p>The binary packages are generated by the OpenSuSE Build Service. They are generated weakly directly from the source packages. As of may 2011 these packages neither include development functions nor the bash front-end. Both can be compiled from the source packages, but then the binary packages would have much more dependencies. As the binary packages are built on line, there are no means to actually verify their content. Only use these packages if You trust the OpenSuSE build service. You can download binary packages for the following distributions (both 32bit and 64bit versions): </p><ul>

Microsoft Windows installer</h1>
<p>The Microsoft Windows version is compiled using Microsoft Visual Studio 10. To be able to install it, first you need to install the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=5555">Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86) </a>. The installer can be found at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/pinkimage/files/Microsoft%20Windows/">SourceForge </a>.</p>
