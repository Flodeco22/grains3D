{\bfseries{Description\+:}} Create a 4D GA (edge-\/weighted graph) from the 4D image obtained by concatenation of the series of 3D images $<$ {\bfseries{prefix\+\_\+inxxxx.\+pgm}} $\vert$ xxxx is a four digit decimal integer of the interval [ {\bfseries{first}} , {\bfseries{last}}] $>$ . The values of the edges are computed according to the parameter {\bfseries{mode}}. If {\bfseries{mode}} is set to 0, then the value of an edge \{ x,y \} is the absolute diference of intensity between the pixels x and y and if {\bfseries{mode}} is set to 1 the maximum of intensity between x and y is used. The output {\bfseries{GA4d\+\_\+out.\+ga}} is a 4D GA, that is a 4D, 8-\/connected, edge-\/weighted grah, (i.\+e. the adjacency is the direct adjacency in dimension 4).
