\brief parallel 3D binary curvilinear, asymetric skeleton based on 3D and 2D residuals

<B>Usage:</B> skel_ACK3 in.pgm nsteps [inhibit] out.pgm

<B>Description:</B> Parallel 3D binary thinning or curvilinear,
asymetric skeleton based on 3D and 2D residuals. The parameter \b nsteps
gives, if positive, the number of parallel thinning steps to be
processed.  If the value given for \b nsteps equals -1, the thinning
is continued until stability.

If the parameter \b inhibit is given and is a binary image name,
then the points of this image will be left unchanged. 

<B>Warning:</B> The object must not have any point on the frame of the image.

<B>Types supported:</B> byte 3d

<B>Category:</B> topobin
\ingroup  topobin
