{\bfseries{Usage\+:}} GAwatershed in.\+ga out.\+pgm [type]

{\bfseries{Description\+:}}

Compute the watershed of a 4-\/connected edge-\/weighted graph (a GA).

If type = 0, then outputs a watershed by an M-\/border algorithm. The file out.\+pgm is a GA.

If type = 1, then outputs a watershed by a non-\/recursive algorithm based on streams. The file out.\+pgm is a GA (this is the default) (not available for floats).

If type = 2 outputs a watershed by a recursive algorithm based on streams. The file out.\+pgm is a GA (not available for floats).

If type = 3 outputs an M-\/border watershed. The file out.\+pgm is a GA (not available for floats).

If type = 4 outputs a flow mapping. The file out.\+pgm is a long integer image that represents a labeled partition induced by a watershed cut of the input GA (not available for floats).

{\bfseries{Types supported\+:}} GA byte 2D, GA float 2D
