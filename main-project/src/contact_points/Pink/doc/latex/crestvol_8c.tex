{\bfseries{Description\+:}} Enhances linear structures in a grayscale image. The algorithm is the following\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}Let F be the original image ("in.pgm")
Let O be the final result ("out.pgm")
Let r be the value of parameter "radius"
Compute k iterations of homotopic thinning, result S
Lower all separating points p in S down to alpha8m(S, p), result Sp 
For each point x of S which is separating
  Let Dx be the image with D(x) = F(x), and D(y) = 0 for all y != x
  Let Fx be the geodesic reconstruction of Dx under F 
  O(x) = volume((Fx-Sp).Br(x)) 
  where Br(x) is the disc centered on x with radius r
EndFor
\end{DoxyVerb}
