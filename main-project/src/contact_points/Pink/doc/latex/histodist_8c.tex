{\bfseries{Description\+:}} Computes the distance between the two histograms given in {\bfseries{h1.\+list}} and {\bfseries{h2.\+list}}. The result is written in {\bfseries{out.\+list}}.

The distance is an edit distance, it is defined as the minimal number of elementary operations (moving one unit from a bin to the neighboring one) that is necessary to transform h1 into h2.

Parameter {\bfseries{type}} (default 0) indicates whether the histogram must be interpreted as circular (type = 1) of not (type = 0). Circular interpretation implies that first and last bins are considered as neighbors.
